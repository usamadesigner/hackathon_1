Pagination is like indexing on a book. For example, if you open any book or particularly a dictionary you can see that first page of a book shows pagination like for alphabet A  there are 3000 words, for B  there are 2000 words  and up to Z  alphabet. Here you will arrange data in form of pages. Each page will hold same number of record. You have to arrange these record into pages. In the video there are 14 pages and you can see as I click on certain page it will show me it's neighboring indexes as well.  The real test in this task is how you will design/code that pagination, make sure that it will work for any number of pages  What we expect from you Use GitHub API or any other third party API to load data and then apply pagination      make sure that your pagination looks like same that we have in demo video (Left and Right spill as well)                Dockerize your APP        You work will be rated on how many stars you have completed
